ðŸŒŸ Day 1: Web Development Practice ðŸŒŸ

Excited to share that Iâ€™ve started my journey into web development! Today, I designed a simple yet functional credit card UI, complete with a card number, cardholder name, and expiry date.

Check it out on GitHub: https://vinayakpandeya.github.io/Credit-_Card-_-UI-_Design-/

Looking forward to continuing this journey and sharing more projects!
